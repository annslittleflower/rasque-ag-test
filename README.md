# rasque-ag-test



## installation

`nvm i`

`nvm use`

`npm run dev`



## useful links

+ [ag-grid tutorial](https://youtu.be/6hxbPqziELk?si=RkJX-TMrITI32U1U) 

+ [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#Quickstart)


## some notes

+  `vite` is used, because `create-react-app` is deprecated
+ code is horrible sometimes due to lack of time, but works 
+ consider this repo as experiment trying to combine react-hook-form + ag-grid, not a production code
+ summary table looks bad, i think its because group features dont work in free ag-grid version
